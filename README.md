- Vectorized N-dimensional numerical arrays.
- Tensor / Nd Array library
- Currently capable of creating CPU Tensors of type T, broadcasting operations, Nd matrix multiplication and 1d and 2d convolution / correlation. 
- Also implements operations such as reshaping, indexing, slicing, padding, expanding, squeezing, unsqueezing, flipping / reversing and permutating  / transposing.
- WIP
